easy (except maybe for some functions).\\r\\n\\r\\nWhen reversing a game, We don\'t mind if the cheat is gonna be External or Internal (maybe I will do a post explaining it based on my knowledge in the future), both of them have pros and cons, and both of them are really similar when We talk about coding the cheat.\\r\\n\\r\\nAssault Cube cheat table (for Cheat Engine):\\r\\n\\r\\n![AssaultCubeCheatTable](./assaultcubeCT.PNG)\\r\\n\\r\\nThe goal is to get a cheat table like that, it\'s not complete, but you can do a lot of things with these pointers and offsets.\\r\\n\\r\\nRemember, there are more ways to get the same result, even in reversing.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will try to explain how to get some good pointers/offsets to work with but I will not go too in depth, as there are a lot of good resources online like [Guided Hacking](https://guidedhacking.com/) and [Unknown Cheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/index.php).\\r\\n\\r\\n## From beginner to advanced:\\r\\n\\r\\n1) **BEGINNER** (Local player and Health):\\r\\n\\r\\nThe basic way is through Cheat Engine and \\"find out what accesses this address\\", but there are other ways for example with REClass.Net.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe gonna start with a basic scan for the health, using granades and decreasing our health, by doing that and after some hits we will find something like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n![AssaultCubeScanHealth](./scanhealth1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow we need a pointer to that otherwise everytime We restart the game, that address is gonna change, and We will need to do this process again.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo find a pointer do a pointer scan with pointermaps or as you want.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that We have a pointer, We have the offset too (in our case 0xF8), and with It We can finally modify our health with our cheat.\\r\\n\\r\\nThrough health you can find the local player too.\\r\\n\\r\\n![AssaultCubeScanHealth](./examplehealth1.png)\\r\\n\\r\\nWith the local player + offsets We can basically access every properties of that particular class.\\r\\n\\r\\n2) **INTERMEDIATE** (Current ammo and Weapon Damage):\\r\\n\\r\\nWe gonna use REClass.Net, a powerful tool to find offsets based on local player (in this case).\\r\\n\\r\\nbefore REClass just scan your ammo that you see for your current weapon type, for example rifle ammo and after that you will find the pointer.\\r\\n\\r\\nNow that We have the rifle ammo ptr, We can find the current weapon offset by reversing with \\"Multi-level pointer base calculation\\".\\r\\n\\r\\nFor reference the calculation is like this (took this formula from Guided Hacking):\\r\\n\\r\\n    Address = Value = ?\\r\\n    base ptr -> address + offset 4 = address\\r\\n    base ptr -> address + offset 3 = address\\r\\n    base ptr -> address + offset 2 = address\\r\\n    static base -> address + offset 1 = address\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd with some scans We have this:\\r\\n\\r\\n    00FCA190 = Value = 20\\r\\n    00FCA474 -> 00FCA190 + 0 = 00FCA190\\r\\n    00FCA3B4 -> 00FCA460 + 14 = 00FCA474\\r\\n    ac_client.exe+10F4F4 -> 00FCA040 + 374 \\r\\n\\r\\nSo the current Weapon offset is 374.\\r\\n\\r\\nWe still have to find the weapon damage, and We will do it with REClass, it will look like this:\\r\\n\\r\\n![AssaultCubeWeaponDmg](./weaponDmg1.PNG)\\r\\n\\r\\n![AssaultCubeWeaponDmg](./weaponDmg2.PNG)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we can see there are a lot of properties beyond the weapon damage, but they need to be reversed.\\r\\n\\r\\n3) **HARD** (Recoil function with IDA):\\r\\n\\r\\nFrom the process showed for the weapon damage, We see that We found recoil too (after some testing).\\r\\n\\r\\nUsing that offset, on Cheat Engine we will find out what accesses to that address, go to disassembler, and retrieve the address:\\r\\n\\r\\n![Recoil](./recoil1.PNG)\\r\\n\\r\\nNow It\'s time for IDA.\\r\\n\\r\\nGoing to that address and Decompiling the assembly instructions We get this:\\r\\n\\r\\n![Recoil](./idarecoil1.PNG)\\r\\n\\r\\nConfusing right? It\'s not easy but with some practice everything will make sense.\\r\\n\\r\\nAfter reversing it (I\'m not gonna explain the whole process because I\'m not the one that should teach you these things):\\r\\n\\r\\n![Recoil](./idarecoil2.PNG)\\r\\n\\r\\n(IDA fucked up the indentation)\\r\\n\\r\\nAs we can see, there is a multilevel pointers calculation to go to the recoil offset, now We can conclude that the instruction where We need to operate on is this one.\\r\\n\\r\\nTo implement no recoil, We can just simply nop this instruction. (**nopping** is pratically \\"hiding\\" that particular instruction without impacting the whole program, and that instruction will never be executed).\\r\\n\\r\\nI hope that you liked this little post :)"},{"id":"journey-1","metadata":{"permalink":"/REwithGraffioh/journey-1","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-06-07-the-journey-so-far/2022-06-07-the-journey-so-far.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-07-the-journey-so-far/2022-06-07-the-journey-so-far.md","title":"The journey so far","description":"The focus of this journey is to get a good understanding of how an anti-cheat work and how to develop it especially for FPS games.","date":"2022-06-06T15:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 6, 2022","tags":[{"label":"game-hacking","permalink":"/REwithGraffioh/tags/game-hacking"},{"label":"reversing","permalink":"/REwithGraffioh/tags/reversing"},{"label":"journey","permalink":"/REwithGraffioh/tags/journey"}],"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"journey-1","title":"The journey so far","tags":["game-hacking","reversing","journey"],"date":"2022-06-06T15:00"},"prevItem":{"title":"Reversing Assault Cube (v1.2.0.2)","permalink":"/REwithGraffioh/2022/06/09/reversing-assault-cube"},"nextItem":{"title":"About me","permalink":"/REwithGraffioh/aboutme"}},"content":"import ReactPlayer from \'react-player\'\\n\\nThe focus of this journey is to get a good understanding of how an anti-cheat work and how to develop it especially for FPS games.\\n\\nEven though I have university, I preferred to do a \\"side\\" project instead of studying only for the exams, because **for me**, if you will graduate without any side project, you wont get very far.\\n\\nSo lets Begin!\\n\\nI started with tutorials on [Cheat Engine](https://cheatengine.org/), a powerful memory tool for game hackers that is really straightforward.\\n\\nFrom there I got a lot of knowledge, from the basic memory concepts to assembly and reverse engineering.\\n\\nAfter having a good level of confidence with CE (Cheat engine), I started to look for cheat forums as I wanted to go more in depth with External/Internal Cheats.\\n\\nI stumbled across [Unknown Cheats](https://www.unknowncheats.me/forum/index.php) and [Guided Hacking](https://guidedhacking.com/). I saw that Guided Hacking changed during the time, it was completely free, but now you need to donate like 15 euros to view posts and download sources.\\n\\nI wasn\'t really into it, I didn\'t want to spend money for things that you can actually learn for free in these days, so I went for Unknown Cheats.\\n\\nThere I started basic external tutorials, with Windows API, in concomitance with [Windows Internals](https://www.amazon.com/Windows-Internals-Part-architecture-management/dp/0735684189/ref=sr_1_1?crid=VCH9SCIRFZDR&keywords=windows+internals+part+1&qid=1654597554&s=books&sprefix=windows+internals+part%2Cstripbooks-intl-ship%2C140&sr=1-1), a really great book by Pavel Yosifovich.\\n\\nI really liked studying these things, so I decided to donate to Guided Hacking for a yearly subscription, as they had a really good \\"path\\" to follow.\\n\\n![Spongebob](./spongebob-RE-meme.png)\\n\\nAfter some experience with External cheats and C++, I went into Internal Cheats as I liked it more, yeah....I like pointers.\\n\\nIn addition to getting experience with Internal Cheats and C++, I started using [REClass.NET](https://github.com/ReClassNET/ReClass.NET/tree/96b36cf7a97d41863b6d75098f681615884d55f7), debuggers like [x64dbg](https://x64dbg.com/) and a disassembler.\\n\\nFor the disassembler I use IDA. (not Ghidra because for IDA there a lot of resources online + plugins).\\n\\nFollowing Guided Hacking tutorial I reversed [Assault Cube](https://assault.cubers.net/), and made an Internal cheats with No recoil, flyhack, god mode and other things, some of them works in multiplayers and some of them don\'t.\\n\\nNow I am \\"reversing\\" CS:GO (of course still following tutorials but not copy-pasting), with quite a bit of difficulty, but I\'m sure I will get through this too.\\n\\nThis is not an easy journey, and I like hard things (no contradictions).\\n\\nAssault Cube trainer example\\n\\n<ReactPlayer player controls url=\'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=huTILhprxls\' />\\n\\n<br/>\\n\\n*Off-Topic*: Miura\'s friend just announced that Him and Miura\'s assistants will resume the serialization of Berserk!!"},{"id":"aboutme","metadata":{"permalink":"/REwithGraffioh/aboutme","editUrl":"https://github.com/facebook/docusaurus/tree/main/packages/create-docusaurus/templates/shared/blog/2022-06-06-About/index.md","source":"@site/blog/2022-06-06-About/index.md","title":"About me","description":"I\'m Umberto, 19 years old from Italy, Computer Science student and passionate about Reverse engineering.","date":"2022-06-06T10:00:00.000Z","formattedDate":"June 6, 2022","tags":[{"label":"about","permalink":"/REwithGraffioh/tags/about"}],"truncated":false,"authors":[],"frontMatter":{"slug":"aboutme","title":"About me","tags":["about"],"date":"2022-06-06T10:00"},"prevItem":{"title":"The journey so far","permalink":"/REwithGraffioh/journey-1"}},"content":"I\'m Umberto, 19 years old from Italy, Computer Science student and passionate about Reverse engineering.\\n\\nWith this blog I want to do a sort of journal through my journey about game hacking.\\n\\n**(FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ONLY!)**\\n\\nI\'ve never wrote a blog before or documented anything online, so this is my first time.\\n\\nI hope you enjoy.
